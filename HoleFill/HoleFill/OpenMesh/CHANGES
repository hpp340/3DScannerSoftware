This file contains the changes, that have been made between two versions
of OpenMesh. It lists only the changes yielding incompatibilities!


1-1-0 -> 1-0-0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- The API of the vector class has been changed slightly due to
  problems with some versions of GCC:

  The cast operator to the scalar type has been removed and replaced by
  the function data(). Hence, existing code like

      Vec3f vertex;
      ...
      glVertex3fv( vertex );

  has to be changed to

      Vec3f vertex;
      ...
      glVertex3fv( vertex.data() );



1-0-0-beta -> 1-0-0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Removed some file to keep the project maintainable:
  testing framework, some utils, IV viewer

- Renamed config.h to config.hh for consistency reasons

- Renamed TexCoord and texcoords() to TexCoord2D and texcoords2D(), 
  since now there are also 1D and 3D texture coordinates.

- Fixed bugs collected during the long beta phase




0-12-0 -> 1-0-0 beta
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Internal data storage has changed. Now each property of
  each entity (vertex/face/...) is stored in a separate array. For
  instance all face normals are in one array now.

- Decimater module handling improved and corrected.

- OBJReader has limited ability to read material files. The diffuse color
  information is used to set the face color property if both are
  available.

- Added tool for View Dependent Progressive Meshes.
  Demo applications are located in in OpenMesh/Apps/VDProgMesh.

- Documentation moved to OpenMesh/Doc.

- OpenMesh/Win/msvc7 contains an MS VC++ solution file and projects viles.

- ASCII based file formats use C I/O functions instead of C++ I/O streams.
  The change increased the speed of reading and writing by factor 2.

- Utility to create triangle strips from a mesh.



0-11-2 -> 0-12-0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- directory structure has changed! 
  Use script migrate.sh to adjust your existing sources and ACGMakefiles 
  software.
- OpenMesh::IO: The read/write methods need now an additional argument
- Namespace MeshIO has been renamed to IO
  Use script migrate.sh to adjust your existing sources.
