(A) Some notes about the .NET compiler!

1. In order to compile and link OpenMesh successfully one needs following 
   settings (Dialog Property Pages -> Configuration Properties):

-> C/C++ -> Language
a. Enable Run-Time Type Info (Option /GR)
b. Force Conformance In For Loop Scope (Option /Zc:forScope)
         
-> C/C++ -> Preprocessor -> Preprocessor Definitions
c. Add define _USE_MATH_DEFINES


2. Optional (recommended) settings

-> C/C++ -> Precompiled Headers
a. Disable usage of precompiled headers

(B) Notes about the OpenMesh solution file

The solution contains the two major projects

> Core    - The OpenMesh base library, with I/O subsystem
> Tools   - Algorithms for Polygonal/Triangle Meshes

Additionally there are projects for (some of) the (some of) the applications in Apps/.
If you have problems building the solution you might encounter error regarding
QT. Please have a look below "(C) QT".

Besides the build modesl Debug and Release you find "Debug STLport" and 
"Release STLport". See (E) STLport

(C) Notes about QT

The applications QtViewer, Subdivider and VDPMSynthesizer need QT for the GUI.
If you don't have QT you need to install it or simply remove the
projects from the solution.

If you have installed QT make sure that the environment variable QTDIR exists.
Furthermore make sure, that 

1. the environment variables QTDIR, TMAKEPATH are available for all users 
  working with QT 
2. $QTDIR/bin is part of the PATH environment variable.

If you add this variables in the system section for environment variables 
(you need administrator privileges) then you need to reboot your system (W2K).
