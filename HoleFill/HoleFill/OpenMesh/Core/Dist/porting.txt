Porting to OpenMesh 1.0:
========================

(Numbered items are handled by migrate.sh!)

1 Include path has changed due to the change of the directory
  structure. Therefore one has to modifiy the include path as follows:
        
  OpenMeshApps  -> OpenMesh/Apps
  OpenMeshTools -> OpenMesh/Tools
  OpenMesh      -> OpenMesh/Core

2 Namespace "MeshIO" has been renamed to "IO".

3 DefaultAttributer has been removed:
  replace DefaultAttributer::* by Attributes::*

4 Replace <OpenMesh/Core/Attributes/Attributer.hh> by
   <OpenMesh/Core/Attributes/Attributes.hh>

5 Replace Base::Refs::* by Refs::* in Traits

6 The entry PROJ_LIBS in the ACGMakefiles have to be adjusted similarly to 1.

* When using I/O functionality make sure that MeshIO.hh is included
  before any kernel type has been included.

* Vector cast is now explicit, have to insert (Vec3f)

* Replace Mesh::point(Vertex&) by Mesh::point(VertexHandle):
  mesh.point(*v_it)  ->  mesh.point(v_it)

* Replace Vertex::{color(),normal(),texcoord()} by
  mesh_.{color,normal,texcoord}(vh)

* Replace Vertex::set_{color(),normal(),texcoord()} by
  mesh_.set_{color,normal,texcoord}(VertexHandle, *)

* Replace Face::{color(),normal()} by
  mesh_.{color,normal}(FaceHandle)

* Replace Face::set_{color(),normal()} by
  mesh_.set_{color,normal}(FaceHandle, *)

* Status: mesh.status(vh).locked()
