This is another UI framework written by Jerome Jiang, which will be used in the future in the new branch. This UI is totally code-based, making it easier to understand the mechanism between front-end and back-end. What's more, it's not just a UI framework. I am adding more and more features to this branch to make it a useable software for mesh view, alignment, registration and more.
