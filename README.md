Development
---
* GUI will be written in Qt for cross platform use
* Now we have added m2plyConverter to the project. See README file in that project.
* We will have Registration algorithm, Poisson Surface Reconstruction, Hole Filling and Remeshing to be added to our software in the future, which makes it usable for our 3D scanning cameras.
* Registration is finished by selecting some points manually since ICP algorithm has been proved not proper for human face applications.
* OpenGL 2.1 and above is supported. Also, you will need to have OpenGL installed on your computer to run the software. For installation guide, check back later.
